Nimbgpdump is a [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) wrapper for the [libbgpdump](https://bitbucket.org/ripencc/bgpdump/wiki/Home) library.

Nimbgpdump is distributed as a [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) package and depends on [nimgen](https://github.com/genotrance/nimgen) and [c2nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/c2nim/) to generate the wrappers. The libxlsxwriter source code is downloaded using Git so having ```git``` in the path is required.

__Installation__

Nimbgpdump can be installed via [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble):

```
> nimble install nimgen

> nimble install nimbgpdump
```
